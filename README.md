# Assemby-String-Encoder

  Presents the user with 3 options: encode, decode and quit, if the user enters 1 then the program will display a messsage 
prompting them to enter thier string and a value around 0-10. 
  
  This limitation is due to the encoding algorthim used as it
encodes by adding the key value to the ascii value of each letter in the string entered, and if the keyvalue is too high it
will cause an error. 
  
  After this the program will redisplay the menu and the user can choose again picking 2 will tell the user
to enter the previously encoded string from this program and the key to decrypt it, the program will then take the key and
subtract its value from the ascii value of each letter and display it. 
  
  After this the program will display the menu again. 
Choosing 3 will quit the program
